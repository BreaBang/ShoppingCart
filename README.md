# ShoppingCart
This is a simple vanilla JavaScript e-commerce website, with only two pages. The site allows users to add items to a cart, update item amounts (increase and decrease), and clear their cart by removing all items.

This cart uses local storage only, although you could easily connect it to a database like MongoDB.
