# ShoppingCart
This is a simple vanilla JavaScript e-commerce website, with only two pages. The site allows users to add items to a cart, update item amounts (increase and decrease), and clear their cart by removing all items.

This cart uses local storage only, although you could easily connect it to a database like MongoDB.
## Setup Notes
If you want to add non-local storage, be sure to create a .gitignore file and add node_modules and .env to the file before pushing to GitHub. Otherwise, this simple e-commerce site as is, does not require any dependencies to be installed.
